# Rules for intercepting commands.
# You can define any command structure using regular expressions.
# Key components:
# (?<recipient>\S+) - This is a named capturing group for the recipient's name. \S+ means "one or more non-space characters".
# (?<message>.+)    - This is a named capturing group for the message content. .+ means "one or more of any character".
intercept-rules:
  # Rule for standard commands like /msg, /tell, /w
  - command-aliases: ["msg", "tell", "w", "m", "pm"]
    type: "direct"
    # This pattern matches: /<command> <one_word_recipient> <rest_is_message>
    pattern: '^\S+ (?<recipient>\S+) (?<message>.+)$'

  # Rule for standard reply commands like /r, /reply
  - command-aliases: ["r", "reply"]
    type: "reply"
    # This pattern matches: /<command> <rest_is_message>
    pattern: '^\S+ (?<message>.+)$'

  # --- EXAMPLE of a convoluted command ---
  # This is an example for a custom command like: /custompm --to PlayerName --text "This is the message"
  # - command-aliases: ["custompm"]
  #   type: "direct"
  #   pattern: '^\S+ --to (?<recipient>\S+) --text "(?<message>.+)"$'
